# CLASSIFICATION OF ELECTRIC TOWERS AND DETECTION OF LINEâ€™S

## The program uses LSD to detect Line segments
## The detected line segments are then merged to extract the Tower


## the implementation of line segment detection is lsd_call_example.c
## the implementation of LSD detector is in lsd.c

# To run

$	make
$	./lsd_call_example 2.pgm 5.eps 700 150

## 2.pgm is input image and 700 is bins and 150 is threshold

## After running following output files are generated
### parallels 
contains all parallel lines detected for each line
### singles 
contains all lines that can be merged into one
### raw-op.txt
contains all line segments extracted
### final.eps 
contains all the merged lines and reconstructed tower.
Convert it to pdf and you can view the image in pdf.
